# So you want to be a Rockstar Developer
Good news! That's no longer a meaningless buzzword. Thanks to the [Rockstar
Programming Language](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar) you can add
that to your CV confident that you'll have a proper answer when recruiters ask
you "What makes you a Rockstar Developer?"

## Really, what is this?
Not much. I learned about this awesome albeit useless language spec and had to
try it for myself. For each _project_ there's the canonical `.rock` file and a
_non-idiomatic_ that should be a bit easier to understand. Just don't expect a
lot of comments: 
> The use of comments in Rockstar programs is strongly discouraged. This is rock'n'roll; it's up to the audience to find their own meaning.

## How do I run these?
There are more than a couple transpilers and not all of them are compatible
with each other or with the full spec. The transpiler that I've tasted this
with is [maiden](https://github.com/palfrey/maiden).
